## Quick Installation
The easiest way to install `govman` on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD) is by using the provided `install.sh` script:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijunda/govman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
This script will download the latest stable release of `govman` for your system, install it to `$HOME/.govman/bin`, and add it to your shell's `PATH`.

For Windows users, you can download the binary directly from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sijunda/govman/releases).

## Getting Started
Getting started with GOVMAN is straightforward. After installation, you can immediately begin managing Go versions.

### Initial Setup
After installation, initialize shell integration for automatic version switching:
```bash
govman init
```
This command adds GOVMAN to your shell configuration and enables auto-switching based on `.go-version` files.

### Basic Usage Examples
1. **Install a Go version:**
   ```bash
   govman install latest
   ```

2. **Switch to a specific Go version:**
   ```bash
   govman use 1.25.1
   ```

3. **List installed versions:**
   ```bash
   govman list
   ```

4. **Set project-specific version:**
   ```bash
   govman use 1.25.1 --local
   ```
   This creates a `.go-version` file in your project directory.

## Documentation
