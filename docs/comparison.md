| **Package Set Management** | ✅ Create isolated package environments | ❌ No package set isolation |
| **Global vs Local** | ✅ Both global and local environments | ✅ Global switching |
| **Memory Footprint** | Larger (bash-based, multiple scripts) | Smaller (single Go binary) |
| **Performance** | Slower (bash script overhead) | Faster (compiled Go binary) |
| **Dependencies** | Requires bash, curl, git, make | Minimal dependencies |
| **Mirror Support** | Limited | ✅ Multiple mirror sites support |
| **Offline Installation** | Partial (cached versions) | ✅ Better offline support |

## Key Commands Comparison

### gvm Commands
```bash
gvm install go1.24.0          # Install Go version
gvm use go1.24.0 --default    # Set as default
gvm list                      # List installed versions
gvm pkgset create myproject   # Create package set
gvm pkgset use myproject      # Use package set
```

### g Commands  
```bash
g install 1.24.0              # Install Go version
g use 1.24.0                  # Switch to version
g ls                          # List installed versions
g ls-remote                   # List available versions
g remove 1.23.0               # Remove version
```

## Recommendations for 2025

**Choose gvm if you:**
- Need advanced GOPATH and package set management
- Work with multiple projects requiring isolated environments  
- Prefer comprehensive feature sets
- Work primarily on Linux/macOS with bash/zsh

**Choose g if you:**
- Want simplicity and speed
- Need reliable Windows support
- Prefer lightweight tools
- Want active maintenance and quick updates
- Need mirror site support for regions with restricted access

## Current Status (2025)
- **gvm**: Mature but slower development cycle
- **g**: Actively maintained with regular updates for latest Go versions
- Both support the latest Go releases (1.24+) but g tends to get updates faster
